                Package net.jini.print.event
                contains classes for reporting printing events
                to a Jini Print Service client.
            <P>
            <H3>Kinds of Events</H3>
            A Jini Print Service instance
            can report the following kinds of events
            to registered event listeners.
            The following events pertain to the Print Service itself:
            <OL TYPE=1>
                <LI> <!-- 1 -->
                    In the Print Service's attribute set,
                    attributes' values changed
                    in a given attribute category or categories.
                    This lets a client track changes in an attribute
                    regardless of which specific values the attribute achieves.
                    <P>
                <LI> <!-- 2 -->
                    In the Print Service's attribute set,
                    attributes' values became equal
                    to a given value or values.
                    This lets a client be notified
                    only when an attribute achieves a specific value or values.
            </OL>
            <P>
                The following events,
                although originating from the Print Service,
                pertain to a Print Job being processed by the Print Service:
            <OL TYPE=1 START=3>
                <LI> <!-- 3 -->
                    The Print Service successfully obtained
                    one piece of print data for the Print Job.
                    This lets a client obtain confirmation
                    that the print data completely arrived
                    at the Print Service.
                    <P>
                <LI> <!-- 4 -->
                    The Print Service failed to obtain
                    one piece of print data for the Print Job.
                    This lets a client find out what went wrong
                    (in the form of an exception)
                    when the Print Service tried to get the print data.
                    <P>
                <LI> <!-- 5 -->
                    In the Print Job's attribute set,
                    attributes' values changed
                    in a given attribute category or categories.
                    This lets a client track changes in an attribute
                    regardless of which specific values the attribute achieves.
                    <P>
                <LI> <!-- 6 -->
                    In the Print Job's attribute set,
                    attributes' values became equal
                    to a given value or values.
                    This lets a client be notified
                    only when an attribute achieves a specific value or values.
                    <P>
                <LI> <!-- 7 -->
                    The Print Job finished processing,
                    having achieved some final state
                    such as "completed," "canceled," or "aborted."
                    This lets a client be notified
                    only when a Print Job is finished
                    and discover its final state.
            </OL>
            <P>
            <H3>Event Classes</H3>
            The UML class diagram below
            shows the classes used to report printing events.
            These all follow the standard Jini event class pattern,
            deriving from class net.jini.core.event.RemoteEvent.

            You can register to receive events pertaining to a Print Service
            by calling the

            method, specifying five arguments:
            <UL>
                <LI>
                    An array of zero or more attribute categories.
                    When an attribute in any of the given categories

                    experiences a change in its value,
                    the Print Service reports a

                <LI>
                    An array of zero or more print service attribute values.
                    When an attribute in the Print Service's attribute set
                    achieves any of the given values,
                    the Print Service reports a

                    <P>
                <LI>
                    A remote event listener object to receive the reported events.
                    <P>
                <LI>
                    A handback object reported to the event listener along with the event itself.

                <LI>
                    A requested initial duration

            </UL>
            <P>
                As part of the process of setting up a Print Request,
                you can register to receive events pertaining to the resulting Print Job
                by calling the
                <A HREF="../job/PrintRequest.html#addEventListener(boolean, boolean, java.lang.Class[], javax.print.attribute.PrintJobAttribute[], boolean, net.jini.core.event.RemoteEventListener, java.rmi.MarshalledObject, long)"><CODE>PrintRequest.addEventListener()</CODE></A>
                method, specifying eight arguments:
            <UL>
                <LI>
                    Whether to report a
                    <A HREF="../job/PrintDataEvent.html">PrintDataEvent</A>
                    to the event listener
                    when the Print Service successfully obtains
                    print data for the job
                    (event kind #3).
                    <P>
                <LI>

                    <A HREF="../job/PrintDataEvent.html">PrintDataEvent</A>
                    to the event listener
                    when the Print Service fails to obtain
                    print data for the job
                    (event kind #4).
                    <P>
                <LI>
                    An array of zero or more attribute categories.
                    When an attribute in any of the given categories
                    in the Print Job's attribute set
                    experiences a change in its value,
                    the Print Service reports a
                    <A HREF="../job/PrintJobEvent.html">PrintJobEvent</A>
                    to the event listener
                    (event kind #5).
                    <P>
                <LI>
                    An array of zero or more print job attribute values.
                    When an attribute in the Print Job's attribute set
                    achieves any of the given values,
                    the Print Service reports a
                    <A HREF="../job/PrintJobEvent.html">PrintJobEvent</A>
                    to the event listener
                    (event kind #6).
                    <P>
                <LI>
                    Whether to report a
                    <A HREF="../job/PrintJobFinishedEvent.html">PrintJobFinishedEvent</A>
                    to the event listener
                    when the Print Service finishes processing the job
                    (event kind #7).
                    <P>
                <LI>
                    A remote event listener object to receive the reported events.
                    <P>
                <LI>
                    A handback object reported to the event listener along with the event itself.
                    <P>
                <LI>
                    A requested initial duration
                    for the event registration lease.
            </UL>
            <P>
                These events pertain to the Print Job
                that results when the Print Request is submitted for printing;
                these events do not pertain
                to the Print Request per se.
            <P>
                You can also register to receive events
                pertaining to an existing Print Job
                by calling the
                <A HREF="../job/PrintJob.html#addEventListener(boolean, boolean, java.lang.Class[], javax.print.attribute.PrintJobAttribute[], boolean, net.jini.core.event.RemoteEventListener, java.rmi.MarshalledObject, long)"><CODE>PrintJob.addEventListener()</CODE></A>
                method, specifying the same eight arguments.
                However, depending on the Print Service implementation,
                you may miss receiving some Print Job events
                that happen before the event registration takes effect.
                By registering for event notifications
                with the Print Request before it is submitted,
                you are guaranteed to receive all Print Job events
                from the point of submission onwards.
            <P>
                Following the standard Jini pattern,
                event registrations are leased.
                You must maintain the event registration leases
                for as long as you wish to receive event notifications.
                When you no longer need to receive event notifications,
                you should cancel the leases.
                (If you fail to cancel the leases,
                they will eventually expire anyway.)
                When an event registration lease expires,
                the Print Service discards that event registration
                and stops sending the event notifications
                specified for that event registration.
            <P>
                Placement of this package under package net.jini.print
                is preliminary and not yet approved by the Jini Community.
