                The above interaction diagram
                shows the interfaces involved
                in printing a job
                consisting of just one doc.
                ("Doc" is a short, easy-to-pronounce term
                that means "a piece of print data.")
                Interfaces declared in package net.jini.print.job
                are highlighted.
                The Jini Print Service instance
                supplies the Print Service, Print Request, and Print Job objects,
                and the client supplies the Doc object.
            <OL TYPE=1>
                <LI>
                    The client searches the Jini Lookup Service (JLUS)
                    for a Jini Print Service instance,
                    and the JLUS returns a Print Service object
                    which implements the base interface

                    telling the printer
                    to create a Print Request to print a single Doc.
                    The printer then returns
                    a Print Request object
                    which implements interface
                    <A HREF="../job/DocPrintRequest.html">DocPrintRequest</A>

                    to specify the doc object to be printed
                    and a set of job-level printing attributes to use for the job.
                    The client can also register event listeners
                    to receive event notifications for the job.
                    Finally, the client calls a method to submit the Print Request
                    to be printed,
                    and the printer returns a Print Job object
                    which implements interface

                    to monitor the Print Job's progress
                    and control the Print Job as the printer processes it.
                    The client can also register event listeners
                    to receive event notifications for the job.
                    Alternatively,
                    if the client doesn't need to monitor or control the job,
                    the client can simply disregard the returned Print Job object.

                All Jini Print Service instances must be capable
                of creating doc print requests.
                Thus, all Jini Print Service proxy objects
                mandatorily implement interface
                <A HREF="../service/PrintService.html">PrintService</A>.
                However, creating multidoc print jobs
                is an optional capability
                that not all Jini Print Service instances
                are required to provide.
                If a Jini Print Service instance
                can create multidoc print requests,
                its service proxy object implements interface
                <A HREF="../service/MultiDocPrintService.html">MultiDocPrintService</A>
                as well as

            <P>
                A Jini Print Service instance
                advertises the kinds of Print Jobs it supports
                by the interfaces its service proxy object implements.
                To get a Jini Print Service instance
                that can print your kind of job,
                make sure to search the JLUS
                for the proper service interface.
                To print a job with a single doc,
                search for a service that implements interface
                <A HREF="../service/PrintService.html">PrintService</A>.
                To print a job with multiple docs,
                search for a service that implements interface
                <A HREF="../service/MultiDocPrintService.html">MultiDocPrintService</A>.
                See the print service lookup scheme in package

            <P>
                All Jini Print Service instances
                must be capable of monitoring print job status.
                Thus, all Jini Print Service instances
                create Print Job objects 
                that implement interface <A HREF="PrintJob.html">PrintJob</A>.
                However, canceling print jobs
                is an optional capability
                that not all Jini Print Service instances
                are required to provide.
                If a Jini Print Service instance
                can cancel print jobs,
                its Print Job objects implement interface
                <A HREF="CancelablePrintJob.html">CancelablePrintJob</A>
                as well as <A HREF="PrintJob.html">PrintJob</A>.
            <P>
                A Print Request object is not a leased resource; it is merely a container for 
                conveying a job request to a Jini Print Service instance.
                When a Print Service creates a Print Request object for a client,
                the Print Service does not allocate any resources
                that have to be cleaned up
                if there is a distributed failure of the client.
            <P>
                A Print Job object, on the other hand,
                <I>is</I> leased resource. When the client submits a Print Request, the 
                Jini Print Service instance creates a Print Job and returns both the Print 
                Job object and a lease object for the Print Job. If the client wants to keep 
                using the Print Job object beyond the lease's duration, the client must renew 
                the lease. When the client no longer needs to use the Print Job object, the 
                client can cancel the lease or simply let it expire. This signals the Jini 
                Print Service instance to clean up resources allocated to the client, if any. 
                However, cancelation or expiration of the Print Job object's lease does not 
                cancel the actual print job, it merely signals that the client will no longer 
                use the Print Job object. The actual print job will continue processing until 
                it has finished printing (barring errors), even if the lease expires or is 
                canceled earlier. Conversely, if the client maintains the lease on the Print 
                Job object beyond the point when the actual print job has finished printing, 
                the client will still be able to use the Print Job object -- for example, to 
                poll its final state. 
            <P>
                The client can register a remote event listener to receive event 
                notifications pertaining to a Print Job object. To ensure that the client 
                receives event notifications starting from the point of submission, the 
                client must register for event notifications with the Print Request object 
                before submitting the Print Request. The client can also register for event 
                notifications with the Print Job object after the request has been submitted, 
                although the client may miss some events that occurred between when the job 
                was submitted and when the event registration took effect. The events that 
                can be reported are represented by classes
                <A HREF="PrintDataEvent.html">PrintDataEvent</A> and
                <A HREF="PrintJobEvent.html">PrintJobEvent</A>. 
            <P>
            <H3>Future Capabilities</H3>
            The following Print Job capabilities
            will be added
            in future versions of the Jini Print Service API:
            <UL>
                <LI>
                    Change print job settings after submission.
                <LI>
                    Dynamic print job control (suspend, resume, reprioritize, redirect, etc.).
            </UL>
            <P>
                Placement of this package under package net.jini.print
                is preliminary and not yet approved by the Jini Community.
