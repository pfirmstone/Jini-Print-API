                The above interaction diagram
                shows the interfaces involved
                in printing a job
                consisting of just one doc.
                ("Doc" is a short, easy-to-pronounce term
                that means "a piece of print data.")
                Interfaces declared in package net.jini.print.job
                are highlighted.
                The Jini Print Service instance
                supplies the Print Service, Print Request, and Print Job objects,
                and the client supplies the Doc object.

                    The client searches the Jini Lookup Service (JLUS)
                    for a Jini Print Service instance,
                    and the JLUS returns a Print Service object
                    which implements the base interface

                <LI>
                    The client calls a method in interface

                    telling the printer

                    The printer then returns
                    a Print Request object

                    <A HREF="job/DocPrintRequest.html">DocPrintRequest</A>

                    <A HREF="job/DocPrintRequest.html">DocPrintRequest</A>
                    to specify the doc object to be printed
                    and a set of job-level printing attributes to use for the job.
                    The client can also register event listeners
                    to receive event notifications for the job.
                    Finally, the client calls a method to submit the Print Request
                    to be printed,

                    to monitor the Print Job's progress
                    and control the Print Job as the printer processes it.
                    The client can also register event listeners
                    to receive event notifications for the job.
                    Alternatively,
                    if the client doesn't need to monitor or control the job,
                    the client can simply disregard the returned Print Job object.

                If a Jini Print Service instance

                its service proxy object implements interface

                To get a Jini Print Service instance
                that can print your kind of job,
                make sure to search the JLUS
                for the proper service interface.
                To print a job with a single doc,
                search for a service that implements interface
                <A HREF="PrintService.html">PrintService</A>.
                To print a job with multiple docs,
                search for a service that implements interface
