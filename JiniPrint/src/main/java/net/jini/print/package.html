            Package net.jini.print contains interfaces for a Jini Print Service
            instance's service proxy object and interfaces that let a Jini 
            Print Service instance obtain from the client the data to be printed

        The above interaction diagram
        shows the interfaces involved
        in printing a job
        consisting of just one doc.
        ("Doc" is a short, easy-to-pronounce term
        that means "a piece of print data.")
        Interfaces declared in package net.jini.print.job
        are highlighted.
        The Jini Print Service instance
        supplies the Print Service, Print Request, and Print Job objects,
        and the client supplies the Doc object.
    </P>
    <OL TYPE=1>
        <LI>
            The client searches the Jini Lookup Service (JLUS)
            for a Jini Print Service instance,
            and the JLUS returns a Print Service object
            which implements the base interface
            {@link net.jini.print.PrintService}.
            (See package {@link net.jini.print.lookup}.)

        <LI>
            The client calls a method in interface
            {@link net.jini.print.PrintService}
            telling the printer
            to create a Print Request to print a single Doc.
            The printer then returns
            a Print Request object
            which implements interface
            {@link net.jini.print.job.DocPrintRequest}
            as well as the base interface
            {@link net.jini.print.job.PrintRequest}.

        <LI>
            The client calls methods in interfaces
            {@link net.jini.print.job.PrintRequest} and
            {@link net.jini.print.job.DocPrintRequest}
            to specify the doc object to be printed
            and a set of job-level printing attributes to use for the job.
            The client can also register event listeners
            to receive event notifications for the job.
            Finally, the client calls a method to submit the Print Request
            to be printed,
            and the printer returns a Print Job object
            which implements interface
            {@link net.jini.print.job.PrintJob}.
            (See package {@link net.jini.print.job}.)

        <LI>
            The printer calls methods in interface {@link Doc}
            to obtain the print data format,
            the document-level printing attributes,
            and the actual print data,
            then proceeds to print the job.

        <LI>
            The client calls methods in interface
            {@link net.jini.print.job.PrintJob}
            to monitor the Print Job's progress
            and control the Print Job as the printer processes it.
            The client can also register event listeners
            to receive event notifications for the job.
            Alternatively,
            if the client doesn't need to monitor or control the job,
            the client can simply disregard the returned Print Job object.

        The above interaction diagram
        shows the interfaces involved
        in printing a job
        consisting of more than one doc -- a "multidoc."
        It is much the same as the previous scenario,
        except a few different interfaces are involved.

            The client searches the Jini Lookup Service (JLUS)
            for a Jini Print Service instance,

            The multidoc provides a "linked list view"
            of the docs to be printed.
            The printer calls a method in interface

            and repeats from Step 4 until it has gotten all the docs.
            The printer then proceeds to print the job consisting of all the docs.

    <H3>Package net.jini.print's Role</H3>
    Package net.jini.print's role in the Jini Print Service API is to:
    <UL>
        <LI>
            Declare the {@link net.jini.print.PrintService} interface,
            which is the base interface
            all Jini Print Service instances' service proxy objects implement,
            whereby the client uses the print service
            to create a Print Request object to print a single doc --
            a "doc print request."
            Interface {@link net.jini.print.PrintService}
            also contains methods to monitor the Print Service's status
            and to discover the Print Service's capabilities.

        <LI>
            Declare the {@link net.jini.print.MultiDocPrintService} interface
            whereby the client creates
            a Print Request object to print multiple docs --
            a "multidoc print request."

        <LI>
            Declare the {@link net.jini.print.LocalizedPrintService} interface
            whereby the client can obtain localized strings
            for print data formats, printing attribute categories,
            and printing attribute values.
        <LI>
            Declare the {@link net.jini.print.Doc} interface
            whereby the printer
            obtains a doc to be printed.
            A doc consists of
            the print data format,
            printing attributes, and
            a print data representation object
            containing the print data itself.
            Interface {@link net.jini.print.Doc}
            in package net.jini.print.data
            extends interface {@link javax.print.Doc}
            in package {@link javax.print}
            but specifies restricted semantics
            for use with a Jini Print Service instance.

        <LI>
            Declare the {@link net.jini.print.LeasedDoc} interface
            whereby the print data source
            can optionally convey a lease on the print data
            to the printer.

        <LI>
            Declare the {@link net.jini.print.MultiDoc} interface
            for providing a group of docs to a single Print Job.
            A multidoc object provides access to the current doc in the group
            and the next multidoc object in the group;
            this "linked list view" allows the printer
            to scan the group of docs in an idempotent fashion,
            which is crucial in a distributed system.
            Interface {@link net.jini.print.MultiDoc}
            in package net.jini.print.data
            extends interface {@link javax.print.MultiDoc}
            in package {@link javax.print}
            but specifies restricted semantics
            for use with a Jini Print Service instance.

    </UL>
    <P>
        All Jini Print Service instances must be capable
        of creating doc print requests.
        Thus, all Jini Print Service proxy objects
        mandatorily implement interface
        {@link net.jini.print.PrintService}.
        However, creating multidoc print requests
        is an optional capability
        that not all Jini Print Service instances
        are required to provide.
        If a Jini Print Service instance
        can create multidoc print requests,
        its service proxy object implements interface
        {@link net.jini.print.MultiDocPrintService}
        as well as
        {@link net.jini.print.PrintService}.
    </P><P>
        A Jini Print Service instance
        advertises the kinds of Print Requests it supports
        by the interfaces its service proxy object implements.
        To get a Jini Print Service instance
        that can print your kind of job,
        make sure to search the JLUS
        for the proper service interface.
        To print a job with a single doc,
        search for a service that implements interface
        {@link net.jini.print.PrintService}.
        To print a job with multiple docs,
        search for a service that implements interface
        {@link net.jini.print.MultiDocPrintService}.
        See the print service lookup scheme in package
        {@link net.jini.print.lookup}
        for further information.
    </P>
    <P>
        A Jini Print Service instance
        advertises the doc flavors it supports
        by including supported doc flavor entries
        in its service registration in the JLUS.
        To get a Jini Print Service instance
        that can print your job's data,
        make sure to include the proper doc flavor
        as a criterion when you search the JLUS.
    </P><P>
        Printing attributes are specified by objects
        that implement interface
        {@link javax.print.attribute.Attribute}
        in package {@link javax.print.attribute}.
        A Jini Print Service instance
        advertises the printing attribute values it supports
        by including supported attribute entries
        in its service registration in the JLUS.
        To get a Jini Print Service instance
        that can support your print job's attributes,
        make sure to include the attributes
        as criteria when you search the JLUS.
        See the print service lookup scheme in package
        {@link net.jini.print.lookup}

        Some print data sources
        may allocate resources
        that need to be deallocated
        if there is a distributed failure
        of the printer.
        In that case the print data source
        can provide a doc object
        that implements interface {@link net.jini.print.LeasedDoc}
        as well as interface {@link Doc},
        thereby conveying a lease on the print data.
        The printer must renew the lease
        until the printer has finished obtaining the print data.
        When the lease expires or is canceled,
        the print data source can deallocate resources.
    </P><P>
        Package net.jini.print.data
        also provides two "tagging base classes,"
        {@link net.jini.print.RemoteInputStream}
        and {@link net.jini.print.RemoteReader}.
        These extend the standard InputStream and Reader base classes
        in package java.io,
        but impose additional requirements
        that let the consumer recover from transient remote errors
        when reading a byte stream or character stream
        in a distributed system.
        A doc whose print data representation object
        is an input stream or a reader
        can actually supply an instance of class
        {@link net.jini.print.RemoteInputStream}
        or {@link net.jini.print.RemoteReader}.
        The Jini Print Service instance
        can test whether the print data representation object
        is actually a
        {@link net.jini.print.RemoteInputStream}
        or {@link net.jini.print.RemoteReader} and, if so,
        perform additional remote error recovery actions
        that are not possible with a plain old InputStream or Reader.
    </P>
    <H3>Future Capabilities</H3>
    The following Print Service capabilities
    will be added
    in future versions of the Jini Print Service API:
    <UL>
        <LI>
            Examine print job queue.
        <LI>
            Dynamic printer control (pause, resume, purge jobs, etc.).
    </UL>
    <P>
        Placement of this package under package net.jini.print
        is preliminary and not yet approved by the Jini Community.
