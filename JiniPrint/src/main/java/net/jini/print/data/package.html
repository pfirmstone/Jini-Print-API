                The above interaction diagram
                shows the interfaces involved
                in printing a job
                consisting of just one doc.
                ("Doc" is a short, easy-to-pronounce term
                that means "a piece of print data.")
                Interfaces declared in package net.jini.print.data
                are highlighted.
                The Jini Print Service instance
                supplies the Print Service, Print Request, and Print Job objects,
                and the client supplies the Doc object.

                    The client searches the Jini Lookup Service (JLUS)
                    for a Jini Print Service instance,
                    and the JLUS returns a Print Service object
                    which implements the base interface

                    telling the printer
                    to create a Print Request to print a single Doc.
                    The printer then returns
                    a Print Request object

                    <A HREF="../job/DocPrintRequest.html">DocPrintRequest</A>
                    to specify the doc object to be printed
                    and a set of job-level printing attributes to use for the job.
                    The client can also register event listeners
                    to receive event notifications for the job.
                    Finally, the client calls a method to submit the Print Request
                    to be printed,

                    The client can also register event listeners

                    Alternatively,
                    if the client doesn't need to monitor or control the job,
                    the client can simply disregard the returned Print Job object.

                Some print data sources

                of the printer.
                In that case the print data source
                can provide a doc object
                that implements interface <A HREF="LeasedDoc.html">LeasedDoc</A>
                as well as interface <A HREF="Doc.html">Doc</A>,
                thereby conveying a lease on the print data.
                The printer must renew the lease
                until the printer has finished obtaining the print data.
                When the lease expires or is canceled,
                the print data source can deallocate resources.

                Package net.jini.print.data

                in a distributed system.
                A doc whose print data representation object
                is an input stream or a reader
                can actually supply an instance of class
                <A HREF="RemoteInputStream.html">RemoteInputStream</A>
                or <A HREF="RemoteReader.html">RemoteReader</A>.
                The Jini Print Service instance
                can test whether the print data representation object
                is actually a
                <A HREF="RemoteInputStream.html">RemoteInputStream</A>
                or <A HREF="RemoteReader.html">RemoteReader</A> and, if so,
