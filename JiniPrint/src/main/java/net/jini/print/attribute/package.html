            Package javax.print.attribute 
            contains classes and interfaces
            that pertain to printing attributes in general.  
            Package net.jini.print.attribute compliments the javax.print.attribute package.
            The discussion below
            describes the attribute classes as a whole
            and explains why they are designed this way.
            Further information may be found
            in the individual attribute classes' documentation.
        </P><P>
            Package javax.print.attribute is used in two printing APIs,
            the Jini Print Service API
            and the Java Print Service API
            (Java Specification Request
            <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/jsr_006_print.html">JSR-000006</A>).
            The description below refers to "the API"
            meaning one or the other or both.

        <P>
        <H3>Background: The Need For Attributes</H3>
        When setting up a print job,
        a client specifies two things:
        <B>print data</B> and <B>processing instructions.</B>
        The print data is the actual content to be printed;
        this may take the form of a text file,
        a PostScript page description, an HTML page, a JPEG image,
        and so on.
        The processing instructions tell the printer
        what media (paper) to use,
        how many copies to print,
        whether to print on one or both sides of a sheet,
        whether to staple each copy,
        and so on.
        <P>
            The print data and the processing instructions
            are in fact separate entities.
            You can print the same print data
            at different times using different processing instructions.
            For example, you could print a slide presentation
            on US letter sized white paper,
            two up (two slides per page),
            double sided, stapled, 20 copies
            to make handouts for a talk;
            and you could print the same slide presentation
            on US letter sized transparencies,
            one up, single sided, one copy
            to make the actual slides for the talk.
            You can also use the same processing instructions
            at different times to print different data.
            For example, you could tell your computer
            that your default processing instructions
            are US letter sized paper, double sided, stapled;
            then whenever you print a job,
            the computer will use those settings
            unless you explicitly override them.
            The processing instructions
            are also called a <B>job template</B>;
            they describe how a job is to be processed
            without telling what data to print.
        <P>
            Observe that each processing instruction
            is a small, atomic data item,
            such as an integer giving the number of copies
            or an enumerated value stating "one-sided" or "two-sided."
            In general, a print job
            contains a <I>set</I> of these small, atomic processing instructions.
            Representing processing instructions as data items
            lets sets of them be easily stored and retrieved.
        <P>
            Observe also that each processing instruction
            is not like a "method" performed on a print job,
            it is rather a <I>description</I> of how the print job should turn out.
            The print job can achieve its specified processing instructions
            in whatever manner it wishes.
            Representing processing instructions as descriptive items
            provides more flexibility for implementing print jobs.
        <P>
            A print job a client submits to a printer, then,
            consists of particular print data
            combined with particular processing instructions:
            job template + print data = print job.
            The print data and the processing instructions
            are associated with each other
            in the context of that print job only.
        <P>
            However, once the printer starts processing the print job,
            additional information about the job becomes available:
            the job name,
            the job state (sitting in a queue, printing, completed, . . .),
            how many pages have been printed so far,
            and so on.
            This set of items constitutes the <B>job description.</B>
        <P>
            But observe that the job description items
            are of the same nature
            as the processing instructions:
            each is a small, atomic data item;
            a set of them is associated with the print job.
            Therefore, it's reasonable to lump processing instructions
            together with job description items
            and refer to all of them as just <B>attributes</B>
            of the print job.
            Some of the attributes the client specified
            when submitting the print job;
            other attributes the print job created on its own.
        <P>
            Now that we have the general concept of an attribute,
            we can use attributes for two additional purposes:
            <B>print data attributes</B>
            and <B>printer description attributes.</B>
        <P>
            Attributes can be associated with print data.
            A print data attribute may describe an inherent characteristic of the data,
            such as whether the data is compressed and which compression algorithm it uses.
            A print data attribute may also specify
            processing instructions to be applied
            to that piece of data only,
            and if a print job consists of multiple pieces of print data,
            different pieces may have different processing instructions.
            For example,
            the first piece of print data in a job may need to print
            on 8.5"x11" white paper media,
            the next piece may need to print
            on 11"x17" white paper media.
        <P>
            Printer description attributes include
            the printer name,
            the printer state (idle, busy, jammed, . . .),
            the number of print jobs in its queue,
            and so on.
        <P>
            To summarize,
            a set of attributes is associated with each of the following:
        <UL>
            <LI>
                A printer -- printer description attributes.
            <LI>
                A print job -- job description attributes, processing instructions.
            <LI>
                A piece of print data -- print data description attributes, processing instructions.
        </UL>

        <P>
        <H3>Attribute Sets</H3>
        The API needs an object for a collection of attributes.
        Besides the obvious requirements
        of being able to add an attribute to the collection
        and remove an attribute from the collection,
        the collection needs to fulfill
        these two more peculiar requirements:
        <OL TYPE=1>
            <LI>
                It must not be possible for two attributes in the same <B>category</B>
                to exist in the collection of attributes.
                For example, an attribute collection
                must not contain both a "one-sided" attribute
                and a "two-sided" attribute;
                if it did, we would be telling the printer to print the job
                in two incompatible ways at the same time,
                and the printer wouldn't know what to do.
                At most one attribute in the category of "sides"
                can exist in an attribute collection,
                and the same is true of every other attribute category.
                However, it makes perfect sense
                for an attribute collection
                to contain both an attribute of "one-sided" in the "sides" category
                and an attribute of "10" in the "copies" category;
                attributes in different categories can coexist with no conflicts.
                <P>
            <LI>
                There must be a way to retrieve from an attribute collection
                the attribute in a given category, if any.
                This is needed for print job implementations.
                A print job needs a way to ask an attribute collection, for example,
                "Give me your sides attribute,"
                without needing to know which particular sides attribute value
                may be stored in the collection.
                The collection would respond with an actual sides attribute value,
                such as "one-sided."
        </OL>
        <P>
            It would be best if a collection class
            from the standard Java Collections Framework
            in package java.util
            could be used for an attribute collection.
            However, the Set abstraction doesn't go far enough;
            it doesn't enforce the restriction of requirement (1),
            and it provides no operation to fulfill requirement (2).
            The Map abstraction
            could fulfill both requirements (1) and (2)
            by using the attribute category as the key
            and the attribute itself as the value,
            thus mapping categories to attributes.
            Unfortunately, the Map abstraction goes too far;
            it allows any arbitrary category to map to any arbitrary attribute,
            it does not enforce the restriction
            that a category must only map to attributes in that category.
            What's needed is a collection somewhere between
            a Set and a Map,
            but the standard Java Collections Framework
            has no such abstraction.
        <P>
            Lacking a standard abstraction that meets our needs
            for an attribute collection,
            the API defines its own attribute collection abstraction,
            the <B>attribute set,</B>
            defined by interface <A HREF="AttributeSet.html">AttributeSet</A>.
            An attribute set contains a group of <B>attribute values,</B> where duplicate values 
            are not allowed in the set. Furthermore, each value in an attribute set is a 
            member of some <B>attribute category,</B> and at most one value in any particular 
            category is allowed in the set. For an attribute set, the values are
            <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A> objects, and the categories are 
            Class objects. An attribute's category is the class at the 
            root of the class hierarchy for that kind of attribute (more on this below).
            An attribute object's 
            category is determined by calling the
            <A HREF="Attribute.html#getCategory()"><CODE>getCategory()</CODE></A> method
            defined in interface <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A>.
        <P>
            Interface <A HREF="AttributeSet.html">AttributeSet</A>
            extends interface java.util.Map,
            so an attribute set is fundamentally a map,
            and all map operations can be applied to an attribute set.
            An attribute set maps 
            attribute categories of type Class (keys) to 
            attribute values of type <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A> (values).
            However, interface <A HREF="AttributeSet.html">AttributeSet</A>
            imposes semantic restrictions on the map
            in order to fulfill requirements (1) and (2).
            All values added to an attribute set must be instances of 
            classes that implement interface <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A>;
            null values are not permitted.
            Furthermore, the key associated with a value added to an 
            attribute set must be the value's attribute category, an instance of class 
            Class. These invariants are guaranteed by the 
            constructors and mutating operations in every implementation of interface 
            <A HREF="AttributeSet.html">AttributeSet</A>.
        <P>
            For convenience, interface <A HREF="AttributeSet.html">AttributeSet</A>
            defines several additional operations 
            patterned after those in interface java.util.Set. These 
            operations allow you to get, add, and remove <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A>
            instances (instead of the generic Objects used in 
            the methods inherited from interface Map). 
        <P>
            Package javax.print.attribute includes
            one concrete implementation of the attribute set interface,
            class <A HREF="HashAttributeSet.html">HashAttributeSet</A>
            providing an attribute set based on a hash map.
            You can use this implementation
            or provide your own implementation
            of interface <A HREF="AttributeSet.html">AttributeSet</A>.
            There is also class <A HREF="AttributeSetViews.html">AttributeSetViews</A>,
            which provides static methods
            for creating an unmodifiable view
            or a synchronized view
            of an attribute set.
        <P>
            The UML class diagram below
            depicts the relationships among the classes mentioned so far.

    <P>
    <H3>Attribute Usage</H3>
    <P>
        Attribute sets are used in several places in the API. In 
        each context, only certain kinds of attributes are allowed to appear in the 
        attribute set.
        To help client programmers understand where various attributes
        can be used in the API,
        and to provide greater compile-time type safety,
        the API defines five tagging subinterfaces
        of interface <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A> --
        <A HREF="DocAttribute.html">DocAttribute</A>,
        <A HREF="PrintRequestAttribute.html">PrintRequestAttribute</A>,
        <A HREF="PrintJobAttribute.html">PrintJobAttribute</A>,
        <A HREF="PrintServiceAttribute.html">PrintServiceAttribute</A>, and
        <A HREF="SupportedValuesAttribute.html">SupportedValuesAttribute</A>.
        Each attribute class
        implements one or more of these tagging subinterfaces
        to indicate where the attribute can be used in the API.
        If an attribute class implements multiple tagging subinterfaces,
        the attribute can be used in multiple contexts.
        Certain low-level attributes
        are never used on their own
        but are always aggregated into higher-level attributes.
        These low-level attribute classes
        implement just interface <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A>,
        not any of the tagging subinterfaces.
    <P>
        The API also provides
        four specializations of an attribute set that are restricted to 
        contain just one of the four kinds of attribute: 
    <UL>
        <LI>
            A <A HREF="DocAttributeSet.html">DocAttributeSet</A>,
            containing <A HREF="DocAttribute.html">DocAttribute</A>s,
            specifies the characteristics of an individual document and the 
            print job settings to be applied to an individual document. 
            <P>
        <LI>
            A <A HREF="PrintRequestAttributeSet.html">PrintRequestAttributeSet</A>,
            containing <A HREF="PrintRequestAttribute.html">PrintRequestAttribute</A>s,
            specifies the settings 
            to be applied to a whole print job and to all the documents in the print job. 
            <P>
        <LI>
            A <A HREF="PrintJobAttributeSet.html">PrintJobAttributeSet</A>,
            containing <A HREF="PrintJobAttribute.html">PrintJobAttribute</A>s,
            reports the status of a print job. 
            <P>
        <LI>
            A <A HREF="PrintServiceAttributeSet.html">PrintServiceAttributeSet</A>,
            containing <A HREF="PrintServiceAttribute.html">PrintServiceAttribute</A>s,
            reports the status of a print service.
    </UL>
    <P>
        Interface <A HREF="SupportedValuesAttribute.html">SupportedValuesAttribute</A>
        denotes an attribute that gives the supported values for another attribute.
        Supported-values attributes
        are never aggregated into attribute sets,
        so there is no attribute set subinterface defined for them.
    <P>
        In some contexts, the client is only allowed to examine an attribute set's 
        contents but not change them (the set is read-only). In other places, the 
        client is allowed both to examine and to change an attribute set's contents 
        (the set is read-write). For a read-only attribute set, calling a mutating 
        operation throws an UnsupportedOperationException. 
    <P>
        Package javax.print.attribute includes
        one concrete implementation of each of the attribute set subinterfaces --
        classes <A HREF="HashDocAttributeSet.html">HashDocAttributeSet</A>,
        <A HREF="HashPrintRequestAttributeSet.html">HashPrintRequestAttributeSet</A>,
        <A HREF="HashPrintJobAttributeSet.html">HashPrintJobAttributeSet</A>,
        <A HREF="HashPrintServiceAttributeSet.html">HashPrintServiceAttributeSet</A>.
        These all extend class <A HREF="HashAttributeSet.html">HashAttributeSet</A>
        and enforce the restriction
        that the attribute set is only allowed to contain
        the corresponding kind of attribute.
    <P>
        The UML class diagram below
        depicts the relationships among the classes mentioned above.

    <P>
    <H3>Attributes</H3>
    Having designed the attribute set classes,
    we turn our attention to the attributes themselves.
    Attributes are used:
    <UL>
        <LI>
            As printer description attributes.
        <LI>
            As job description attributes.
        <LI>
            As print data description attributes.
        <LI>
            As processing instructions.
        <LI>
            To represent a printer's capabilities.
    </UL>
    In the latter role,
    a printer advertises its capabilities for printing jobs
    by telling which attribute categories
    the printer will let the client specify
    as part of a print job
    and which particular values of those attributes
    the printer can support.
    <P>
        The attribute classes' design must address these requirements:
    <OL TYPE=1>
        <LI><!--1-->
            An attribute value is a small, atomic data item,
            such as an integer or an enumerated value.
            (We need to decide how to represent these data items.)
            <P>
        <LI><!--2-->
            Each attribute value must be a member of a category
            so the value can be put into and retrieved out of an attribute set.

            The API must define a broad set

            The attribute classes must be useful
            for printing applications in general.
            In particular, the attribute classes must be applicable
            both to Jini printing
            and to core Java printing,
            and they must be usable in future versions
            of the JDK printing classes in package java.awt.print.

    <P>
        Considering requirement (1),
        we could use primitive data types like <CODE>int</CODE>
        to represent attribute values.
        However, this is not type-safe.
        The compiler should not let us, for example,
        use a "copies" attribute value as a "sides" attribute.
        But if attributes were represented by primitive data types like <CODE>int</CODE>,
        we could use a "copies" value of 2 (meaning two copies)
        as a "sides" attribute value (meaning, perhaps, two-sided).
        In addition, some attributes have to be represented
        as a record of several values,
        like a printer resolution which requires two numbers
        (e.g., 600 x 300 dpi).
        Therefore, for type safety
        and to represent all attributes uniformly
        including single-valued and record-valued attributes,
        each attribute is defined as a class:
        class Copies, class Sides, class PrinterResolution, and so on.
        Each attribute class wraps one or more
        primitive data items (fields)
        containing the attribute's value.
    <P>
        The natural answer to requirement (2), then,
        is to use the attribute classes as the categories
        for an attribute set.
        We can use either the name of the attribute class (a String object)
        or the attribute class itself (a Class object)
        as the category object.
        Now, attribute set operations
        have to do frequent comparisons
        between attribute category objects:
        when adding an attribute,
        to find any existing attribute in the same category;
        when looking up an attribute
        given the category.
        Therefore, comparisons between attribute category objects
        (specifically, the <CODE>equals()</CODE> operation)
        should be fast.
        The <CODE>Class.equals()</CODE> operation
        is just object identity comparison (<CODE>==</CODE>)
        and is very fast.
        The <CODE>String.equals()</CODE> operation, however,
        requires examining the two strings character-by-character
        until a match is proven or disproven,
        which is much slower than <CODE>==</CODE>.
        Therefore, for speed of attribute category comparisons
        the attribute class is used as the category.
    <P>
        Returning to requirement (1),
        note that even though there is a large number
        of different attributes (categories),
        there are only a few different <I>types</I> of attribute values.
        Most attributes take on an enumerated value
        (such as Sides: "one-sided", "two-sided," and so on)
        or an integer value
        (such as Copies).
        A few attributes take on a more complicated value
        (such as PrinterResolution).
        The type of value an attribute takes on
        is called the attribute's <B>abstract syntax.</B>
        All the enumeration-valued attributes share the same abstract syntax,
        all the integer-valued attributes share the same abstract syntax,
        and so on;
        what distinguishes particular attributes from one another
        is the attribute class (category).
        Therefore, the API
        defines a small number of <B>abstract syntax classes</B>
        in package javax.print.attribute:
    <UL>
        <LI>
            Enumeration-valued attributes use an abstract syntax class of
            <A HREF="EnumSyntax.html">EnumSyntax</A>,
            which provides a type-safe enumeration
            where enumerated values are represented as singleton objects.
            Each enumeration singleton
            is an instance of the enumeration class
            that wraps a hidden <CODE>int</CODE> value
            (a different value for each singleton).
            <P>
        <LI>
            Integer-valued attributes use an abstract syntax class of
            <A HREF="IntegerSyntax.html">IntegerSyntax</A>.
            <P>
        <LI>
            Text-valued attributes use an abstract syntax class of
            <A HREF="TextSyntax.html">TextSyntax</A>,
            which includes a locale giving the text string's natural language.
            <P>
        <LI>
            Attributes whose value is a range or set of integers
            use an abstract syntax class of
            <A HREF="SetOfIntegerSyntax.html">SetOfIntegerSyntax</A>.
            <P>
        <LI>
            Attributes whose value is a resolution
            (e.g., a printer resolution of 600 x 300 dpi)
            use an abstract syntax class of
            <A HREF="ResolutionSyntax.html">ResolutionSyntax</A>.
            <P>
        <LI>
            Attributes whose value is a two-dimensional size
            (e.g., a paper size of 8.5 x 11 inch)
            use an abstract syntax class of
            <A HREF="Size2DSyntax.html">Size2DSyntax</A>.
            <P>
        <LI>
            Attributes whose value is a date and time
            use an abstract syntax class of
            <A HREF="DateTimeSyntax.html">DateTimeSyntax</A>.
            <P>
        <LI>
            Attributes whose value is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
            use an abstract syntax class of
            <A HREF="URLSyntax.html">URLSyntax</A>.
    </UL>
    <P>
        The abstract syntax classes are named <CODE>"...Syntax"</CODE>
        to emphasize that they are just containers
        for certain kinds of values,
        they are not themselves printing attributes per se.
        In fact, the abstract syntax classes,
        especially <A HREF="EnumSyntax.html">EnumSyntax</A>,
        could be used in applications having nothing to do with printing.
        Since the abstract syntax classes
        are not themselves printing attributes,
        they do not implement interface <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A>.
    <P>
        Each attribute class, then,
        implements interface <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A>,
        either directly or indirectly,
        to mark it as a printing attribute.
        An attribute class that can appear in restricted attribute sets
        in certain contexts
        also implements one or more subinterfaces
        of interface <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A>.
        Each attribute class extends the appropriate abstract syntax class
        to get its implementation.
        For example:
    <PRE>
    public class Sides
        extends EnumSyntax
        implements DocAttribute, PrintRequestAttribute, PrintJobAttribute
        {
        public final Object getCategory()
            {
            return Sides.class;
            }
        . . .
        }
</PRE>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../doc-files/JavaxPrintAttributeFig2.gif" WIDTH=631 HEIGHT=208>
</CENTER>
<P>
Since every attribute class
implements interface <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A>,
every attribute class must provide an implementation for the
<A HREF="Attribute.html#getCategory()"><CODE>getCategory()</CODE></A> method
which returns the attribute category.
In the case of Sides, this method returns
the Class object for class Sides, namely <CODE>Sides.class</CODE>.
To ensure that any vendor-defined subclasses
of a standard attribute class
appear in the same category (requirement (4)),
the method is tagged as final
to ensure the vendor cannot override it in a subclass.
<P>
One final word about the attribute classes:
Each attribute object is designed to be immutable
once constructed.
This allows attribute object references
to be freely passed around
without worrying that someone
will change the attribute's value.
To get a different attribute value,
construct a different attribute object.
<P>
To address requirement (3),
the API defines a group of standard attribute classes
modeled upon the attributes
in the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) version 1.1.
The standard attribute classes
are placed in the subpackage
<A HREF="standard/package-summary.html">javax.print.attribute.standard</A>
merely to keep the actual attribute classes
conceptually separate
from the generic apparatus
defined in package javax.print.attribute.
<P>
To address requirement (4),
there needs to be a way
for a vendor to define
new vendor-specific values
for any standard printing attribute.
This is no problem for any attribute
that uses an abstract syntax class
other than <A HREF="EnumSyntax.html">EnumSyntax</A>;
at run time the client can
construct instances of such attributes
with arbitrary values,
including vendor-specific values.
However, an enumerated attribute
using an abstract syntax class of <A HREF="EnumSyntax.html">EnumSyntax</A>
specifies all the possible attribute values
at compile time
as singleton instances of the attribute class,
and there is no way to construct new vendor-specific values
at run time.
Thus, to define new vendor-specific values
for a standard enumerated attribute,
the vendor must define a new attribute class
specifying the new singleton instances.
To ensure that the new attribute values
fall in the same category as the standard attribute values,
the new attribute class must be a subclass
of the standard attribute class.
<P>
To address requirement (5),
there needs to be a way
for a vendor to define
new vendor-specific printing attributes.
This is easily accomplished
by defining a new attribute class
that implements interface <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A>
(or subinterfaces thereof)
and extends the appropriate abstract syntax class,
either an existing one or a new one.
In this way the vendor can create
a whole new category of attribute
that can be used wherever an <A HREF="Attribute.html">Attribute</A> is used,
such as in an <A HREF="AttributeSet.html">AttributeSet</A>.
<P>
To address requirement (6) for the Jini Print Service API,
we have to include printing attributes
as service attributes in the service registration
for a Jini Print Service instance.
Service attributes must be objects
that implement interface net.jini.core.entry.Entry.
Furthermore, the only things the JLUS considers
when searching for a service
are the public non-primitive fields
of the Entry objects in the service registration.
Since we have decided an attribute class
is a wrapper for primitive fields,
this rules out using attribute objects directly as Entry objects,
for then the JLUS would not look at the attribute's primitive fields.
Also, making the attribute's fields public would break encapsulation,
and making the attribute classes implement interface net.jini.core.entry.Entry
is undesirable if the attribute classes are to be used
outside the Jini Print Service API (requirement (7)).
Therefore, attribute objects are not used directly
as service attributes in the service registration.
<P>
If an Entry class for a Jini Print Service instance
is not the attribute class itself,
then the Entry class must be a wrapper of some sort
for the attribute class.
There could be a single, generic attribute Entry class
that stored any kind of attribute in a public field,
something like this:
<PRE>
    public class AttributeEntry
        implements Entry
        {
        public Attribute attribute;
        }
</PRE>
Or there could be a separate Entry class
for every attribute class,
so the Entry class hierarchy exactly mirrors
the attribute class hierarchy,
something like this:
<PRE>
    public class SidesEntry
        implements Entry
        {
        public Sides sides;
        }
    public class CopiesEntry
        implements Entry
        {
        public Copies copies;
        }
    . . .
</PRE>
The downside of a mirrored Entry hierarchy
is the large number of extra classes needed --
one Entry class for every attribute class.
The upside of a single, generic attribute Entry class
is we only have to define one additional class.
However, the downside of a single, generic attribute Entry class
is it loses the knowledge of the attribute class hierarchy.
With the <CODE>AttributeEntry</CODE> class defined above,
the JLUS would be able to search
only for specific attribute values;
the JLUS would not be able to search
for any attribute value in a given attribute class (category).
<P>
However, we can fix that problem
by including two more fields in the generic attribute Entry:
<PRE>
    public class AttributeEntry
        implements Entry
        {
        public String category;
        public String runtimeClass;
        public Attribute value;
        }
</PRE>
The fields are, respectively,
the fully-qualified class name of the attribute's category;
the fully-qualified class name of the attribute's runtime class
(which may be the same as the category or a subclass thereof);
and the attribute's value.
The category and the class are declared as String objects
rather than Class objects
because Entry fields are stored in the JLUS
in marshalled (serialized) form.
The marshalled form of a Class object
includes the fully-qualified class name string
plus a bunch of other information --
a serial version ID, some flags,
and a list of descriptors for the class's fields.
Since only the class name is relevant for JLUS searches,
it reduces storage and search time
to include just a String object with the class name in the Entry,
omitting the extraneous information
contained in a marshalled Class object.
<P>
To search the JLUS for a Jini Print Service instance
that supports a given attribute <I>category</I>,
the client sets up a service template
with an <CODE>AttributeEntry</CODE>
with the <CODE>category</CODE> field
containing the category name
and the <CODE>runtimeClass</CODE> and <CODE>value</CODE> fields
wildcarded (null).
To search the JLUS for a Jini Print Service instance
that supports a given attribute <I>value</I>,
the client sets up a service template
with an <CODE>AttributeEntry</CODE>
with the <CODE>category</CODE> field
containing the category name,
the <CODE>runtimeClass</CODE> field
containing the attribute object's runtime class name
(which may be a subclass of the category),
and the <CODE>value</CODE> field
containing the attribute value itself.
The attribute's runtime class has to be included
to distinguish a value in a subclass
from a value in a superclass
if the two values happen to have
the same marshalled form in the Entry
(which can happen with enumerated attributes).
<P>
The Entry class scheme just described
allows the client to search the JLUS
both for attribute categories
and for attribute values
while requiring only a single, generic Entry class
rather than a whole mirrored hierarchy of Entry classes.
Therefore, the Jini Print Service API
uses the Entry class scheme just described.
See package <A HREF="../../../net/jini/print/lookup/package-summary.html">net.jini.print.lookup</A>
for further information.
<P>
Finally, requirement (7) is fulfilled
by relegating all Jini-specific aspects of printing attributes
to other parts of the Jini Print Service API
in the net.jini.print namespace.
In particular, as already mentioned,
the attribute classes do not themselves
implement interface net.jini.core.entry.Entry.
Also, everything in package
<A HREF="../../../net/jini/print/lookup/package-summary.html">net.jini.print.lookup</A>
related to registering printing attributes in the JLUS
and searching for printing attributes in the JLUS
is layered on top of the attribute classes
rather than integrated into the attribute classes.

<P>
Placement of this package under package javax.print
is preliminary and not yet approved by the Java Community
or the Jini Community.
