/**
 * <p>
 * The "stitching" member attribute (originally defined in section 3.2.2 of
 * [PWG5100.3]) specifies the locations of stitches or staples that are used to
 * bind the hardcopy output. Printers with a stapler and/or stitching finisher
 * MUST support this member attribute and all "stitching-xxx" member attributes
 * if they support the "finishings-col" attribute.
 * </p><p>
 * A Client that chooses to request custom stitching using the "stitching"
 * collection attribute MUST specify the "stitching-reference-edge", the
 * "stitching-offset", and the "stitching-locations" member attributes. If the
 * Client supplies a malformed request by not supplying all three member
 * attributes, the Printer MUST (depending on implementation) either reject the
 * request and return the â€˜client-error-bad-request' (see [RFC2911] section
 * 13.1.4.1) or default the omitted member attributes, independent of the value
 * of the "ipp-attribute-fidelity" attribute supplied by the Client.
 * </p>
