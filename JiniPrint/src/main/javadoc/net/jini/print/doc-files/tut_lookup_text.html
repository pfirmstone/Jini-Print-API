<H2>Lesson 3. Lookup</H2>
<P>
The second shortcoming of the code in
<A HREF="tut_basics.html" TARGET="_parent">Lesson 1</A>
is that it asks the Jini Lookup Service (JLUS)
to find any old Jini Print Service instance.
There's no guarantee
that the Jini Print Service instance it finds
will be able to do what we need it to do --
that is, print in landscape orientation,
on 8.5 x 11 inch pink paper, and so on.
If the Jini Print Service instance
doesn't support those printing attributes,
it will report an error
and the job won't print.
However, it would be far better
to find a Jini Print Service instance
that supported those printing attributes in the first place
than to report an error
after picking a Jini Print Service instance
that happened not to support those attributes.
<P>
To tell the JLUS to find a print service
that supports the features needed,
include <B>service attributes</B> in the service template
used for lookup.
Below is the example code fragment from
<A HREF="tut_printdataattr.html" TARGET="_parent">Lesson 2</A>
with an augmented service template.
<P>
First, lines 28-33 construct and save the
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/standard/Media.html" TARGET="_parent">Media</A>
attribute we want.
We will use this Media attribute in two places later.
<P>
One characteristic of a doc object
is its "doc flavor."
The doc flavor specifies the format of the print data
obtained from the doc.
The print data format consists of two things,
a MIME type
and a print data representation class.
The doc flavor of the doc class we're using,
class <A HREF="../../../../org/jpwg/jini/print/data/StringDoc.html" TARGET="_parent">StringDoc</A>,
uses a MIME type of <CODE>"text/plain; charset=unicode"</CODE>
and a print data representation class name of <CODE>"java.lang.String"</CODE>.
When the Jini Print Service instance
asks the doc object for the print data,
the doc object returns
an instance of the print data representation class --
String in this case.
The Jini Print Service instance
knows how to extract the actual print data
from the print data representation object
(as specified in interface
<A HREF="../job/PrintJob.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintJob</A>).
When the Jini Print Service instance gets the print data,
it interprets the print data based on the MIME type --
in this case, plain text in the Unicode character set.
<P>
A Jini Print Service instance
typically supports several doc flavors
with various combinations
of various MIME types
and various print data representation classes.
See class <A HREF="../../../../javax/print/data/DocFlavor.html" TARGET="_parent">DocFlavor</A>
for a list of typical doc flavors
that may be supported.
Furthermore, a Jini Print Service instance
advertises the doc flavors it supports
by including <A HREF="../lookup/FlavorEntry.html" TARGET="_parent">FlavorEntry</A>
service attributes
in its service registration in the JLUS.
<P>
In addition, a Jini Print Service instance
advertises the printing attribute values it supports
by including <A HREF="../lookup/AttributeEntry.html" TARGET="_parent">AttributeEntry</A>
service attributes
in its service registration in the JLUS.
Support for Media attributes
is advertised with another service attribute,
<A HREF="../lookup/MediaEntry.html" TARGET="_parent">MediaEntry</A>.
<P>
The fact that a Jini Print Service instance
advertises the doc flavors and printing attribute values it supports
in its service registration
means that we can search the JLUS
for Jini Print Service instances
that are guaranteed to be able to print our job.
We do it by setting up a different service template
on lines 43-49.
The service ID is still null (wildcard)
and the service object's type is still
<A HREF="../service/PrintService.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintService</A>.
But now we will also specify some service attributes
as an array of class net.jini.core.entry.Entry.
(Keep in mind that there is a distinction
between a <I>service</I> attribute used when calling JLUS methods
and a <I>printing</I> attribute used when calling Jini Print Service methods.)
<P>
The service attributes are of three kinds:
<UL>
<LI>
Service attributes that denote doc flavors
we are going to use,
which we need the Jini Print Service instance to support.
<LI>
Service attributes that denote printing attributes
we are going to specify,
which we need the Jini Print Service instance to support.
<LI>
Service attributes that denote general characteristics
like printer name, location, manufacturer, and so on.
</UL>
<P>
To specify a needed doc flavor
in the service template,
wrap the doc flavor
inside a service attribute of class
<A HREF="../lookup/FlavorEntry.html" TARGET="_parent">FlavorEntry</A>.
Line 47 gets the doc flavor from our doc object
and wraps it inside a
<A HREF="../lookup/FlavorEntry.html" TARGET="_parent">FlavorEntry</A>.
<P>
To specify a needed Media attribute value
in the service template,
wrap the Media attribute value
inside a service attribute of class
<A HREF="../lookup/MediaEntry.html" TARGET="_parent">MediaEntry</A>.
Line 48 wraps the required Media attribute
(created back on line 28)
inside a <A HREF="../lookup/MediaEntry.html" TARGET="_parent">MediaEntry</A>.
<P>
To specify a needed printing attribute value
(other than Media)
in the service template,
wrap the printing attribute value
inside a service attribute of class
<A HREF="../lookup/AttributeEntry.html" TARGET="_parent">AttributeEntry</A>.
Line 49 wraps the required orientation attribute,
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/standard/OrientationRequested.html#LANDSCAPE" TARGET="_parent"><CODE>OrientationRequested.LANDSCAPE</CODE></A>,
inside an
<A HREF="../lookup/AttributeEntry.html" TARGET="_parent">AttributeEntry</A>.
<P>
The
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/standard/DocumentName.html" TARGET="_parent">DocumentName</A>
and
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/standard/JobName.html" TARGET="_parent">JobName</A>
attributes are not used for searching the JLUS
and should not be included in the service template.
Since all printers let you specify any document name or job name for a print job,
there's no point in searching for a printer
based on whether it supports the document name or job name attributes.
<P>
To specify a general characteristic
in the service template,
include a service attribute of class
<A HREF="../lookup/PrinterDescriptionEntry.html" TARGET="_parent">PrinterDescriptionEntry</A>
with the required fields filled in
and the other fields set to null.
The example code doesn't put any general characteristics
in the service template.
But if, for example,
we had wanted to find a Jini Print Service instance
that could print our job
and that was named <CODE>"Bill Clinton's Printer"</CODE>,
we might have added something like this
to the service template
after line 49:
<P>
<PRE>
    new PrinterDescriptionEntry
        (new PrinterName ("Bill Clinton's Printer", Locale.getDefault()),
         null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null)});
</PRE>
<P>
Line 51 calls the JLUS's <CODE>lookup()</CODE> method
to get the service object.
With this more specific service template,
the JLUS will only find a Jini Print Service instance
(a service that has registered a service object of class
<A HREF="../service/PrintService.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintService</A>)
that supports printing plain text strings
in landscape orientation
on 8.5 x 11 inch pink paper
(a service that has registered service attributes
equal to those on lines 47-49).
The Jini Print Service API
has detailed requirements for
the service attributes a Jini Print Service instance
must include in its service registration.
These service attributes
describe the Jini Print Service instance's capabilities
and permit the JLUS to perform searches
like the one coded here.
See package <A HREF="../lookup/package-summary.html" TARGET="_parent">net.jini.print.lookup</A>
for further information on the service attribute scheme.
<P>
It should be noted that in this example,
the JLUS's search algorithm,
which matches attributes for equality,
did the right thing
for the attributes we specified.
This would not be the case for all attributes.
For some attributes,
equality is not the right criterion
to decide whether the attribute
in the Jini Print Service instance's service registration
matches the attribute
the client specified in the service template.
Later Lessons will give examples of such attributes.
