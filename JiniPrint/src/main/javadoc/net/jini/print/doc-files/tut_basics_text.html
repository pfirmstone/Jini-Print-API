<H2>Lesson 1. The Very Basics</H2>
<P>
Below is an example code fragment that uses the Jini Print Service
to print a simple string, the proverbial "Hello, world!"
<P>
Lines 1-7 import all the requisite Java classes and interfaces.
Line 9 sets up an exception handling context
for dealing with errors that may occur while printing.
The real meat comprises lines 11-25.
<P>
To print anything with a Jini Print Service,
you have to wrap up whatever you're going to print
inside an object called a "doc."
The Jini Print Service instance
will discover everything it needs to know about your job
by calling methods on the doc object,
which are declared in interface
<A HREF="../data/Doc.html" TARGET="_parent">Doc</A>.
Line 11 constructs a doc object
which is an instance of class
<A HREF="../../../../org/jpwg/jini/print/data/StringDoc.html" TARGET="_parent">StringDoc</A>.
This class
(provided as a sample implementation
in package <A HREF="../../../../org/jpwg/jini/print/data/package-summary.html" TARGET="_parent">org.jpwg.jini.print.data</A>
but not part of the Jini Print Service API)
is designed for printing Java strings.
(We could have written our own implementation
of interface <A HREF="../data/Doc.html" TARGET="_parent">Doc</A>,
but it's less work to use the existing class.)
The first constructor argument is the string to be printed,
<CODE>"Hello, world!"</CODE>.
The second constructor argument, null,
says to use default values for the doc's printing attributes
(more on this in <A HREF="tut_printdataattr.html" TARGET="_parent">Lesson 2</A>).
<P>
Now that we have a doc object,
we need a Jini Print Service instance
to print it on.
Line 12 obtains the Jini Lookup Service's (JLUS's) proxy object,
which implements interface ServiceRegistrar.
The JLUS's proxy object can be obtained
using any of several standard techniques
which are not covered here.
<P>
Lines 13-17 construct a service template
that will be used to search the JLUS
for a Jini Print Service instance.
The first constructor parameter is null,
signifying that any service ID will match our search.
The second constructor parameter
is an array of one class,
signifying that any service object
that implements interface
<A HREF="../service/PrintService.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintService</A>
will match our search.
<A HREF="../service/PrintService.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintService</A>
is an interface implemented
by the service object every Jini Print Service instance
registers into the JLUS;
it is the relevant interface for our purpose
of printing out a single doc.
The third constructor parameter is null,
signifying that any JLUS service attributes whatsoever
will match our search.
So, we are simply looking for any Jini Print Service instance;
we don't care what its service ID is
or what its attributes are.
<P>
Lines 18-19 obtain the Jini Print Service instance's service object
from the JLUS.
By using this form of the <CODE>lookup()</CODE> method,
we are saying we don't care which Jini Print Service instance we get
if more than one happens to be registered in the JLUS.
The returned service object is cast from class Object
to interface
<A HREF="../service/PrintService.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintService</A>,
which is the interface we need to call.
<P>
Now that we have a doc object and a Print Service object,
we can start setting up the print job.
After making sure on line 20
that the JLUS really did find an instance of the Jini Print Service,
line 23 uses a factory method in the Print Service object
to create a Print Request object
that is bound to this Jini Print Service instance.
The first argument is the doc to be printed,
namely, the doc object containing the <CODE>"Hello, world!"</CODE> string.
The second argument, null,
says to use default values for the print job's printing attributes
(again, more on this in <A HREF="tut_printdataattr.html" TARGET="_parent">Lesson 2</A>).
The returned Print Request object
encapsulates the specified doc and printing attributes.
The Print Request object implements interfaces
<A HREF="../job/PrintRequest.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintRequest</A> and
<A HREF="../job/DocPrintRequest.html" TARGET="_parent">DocPrintRequest</A>
as well as other interfaces depending on
this Jini Print Service instance's capabilities.
Line 22 stores the returned Print Request object
as an instance of interface
<A HREF="../job/PrintRequest.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintRequest</A>,
which is the interface we need to call.
<P>
Line 24 tells the Print Request to submit itself
to the printer.
The printer calls the Print Request's doc object's methods
to extract the print data,
namely the characters in the string,
and prints a job with that data.
The job prints on the printer
associated with the Jini Print Service instance
that created the Print Request.
<P>
Finally, lines 26-40 contain error and exception handling code
for various error conditions.
The exceptions are checked exceptions
thrown by the methods called in lines 11-25,
so exception handlers must be written for them
or the code will not compile.
<P>
The first exception handler,
for <A HREF="../../../../javax/print/exception/PrintException.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintException</A>,
catches all printing-related error conditions.
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/exception/PrintException.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintException</A>
is a base class;
the Print Service and Print Job methods
actually throw more specific exceptions
that are subclasses of
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/exception/PrintException.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintException</A>.
This gives you programming flexibility:
you can either write one exception handler
for all the printing error conditions,
as this example does,
or you can write separate exception handlers
to do different things for different printing error conditions.
<P>
The second exception handler, for RemoteException,
would be executed if the Jini Print Service instance's service object
used a remote implementation
and a remote error happened --
the remote server crashed, the network failed.
If the Jini Print Service instance's service object
used a local implementation,
RemoteException would never get thrown.
But since the client code doesn't know
how the Jini Print Service instance's service object is implemented,
the client code must provide for the possibility of a RemoteException.
<P>
To summarize, the basic pattern for printing
using the Jini Print Service is:
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI> Create a Doc object.
<LI> Obtain the Jini Print Service instance's Print Service object from the JLUS.
<LI> Create a Print Request object encapsulating the Doc object.
<LI> Submit the Print Request to be printed.
</OL>
<P>
Although this code will probably work,
it has several shortcomings.
The next several lessons will
rectify these shortcomings.
