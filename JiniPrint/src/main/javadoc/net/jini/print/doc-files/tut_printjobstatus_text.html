<H2>Lesson 4. Print Job Status</H2>
<P>
The Jini Print Service API
lets you monitor the status of your print job
after you have submitted the Print Request.
There are two ways to do it,
by polling the print job's attributes
(covered in this Lesson)
and by receiving event notifications from the print job
(covered in <A HREF="tut_printjobevents.html" TARGET="_parent">Lesson 5</A>).
<P>
When you submit a Print Request,
the Jini Print Service instance
creates a Print Job object
that implements interface
<A HREF="../job/PrintJob.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintJob</A>.
In the previous Lessons,
this Print Job object was never returned
to our client program
and we never did anything with it.
However, it is possible to have the Print Job object
returned when you submit a Print Request.
The Print Job object lets you,
among other things,
examine the job's <B>job description attributes.</B>
Various job description attributes
indicate the job's state,
how many jobs are ahead of it in the print queue,
how many sheets it has printed, and so on.
The Jini Print Service instance
updates the values of these attributes dynamically
as it processes the print job.
Some of these attributes are mandatory
and will be reported by all Jini Print Service implementations;
others are optional and may or may not be reported.
See package
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/standard/package-summary.html" TARGET="_parent">javax.print.attribute.standard</A>
for a list of all the job description attributes.
<P>
We want our example client program
to report the print job's state once a second
until the job is finished.
Below is the example code fragment from
<A HREF="tut_lookup.html" TARGET="_parent">Lesson 3</A>
expanded to monitor and report the print job state.
<P>
Line 35 constructs a Lease Renewal Manager (LRM)
which we will need later.
<P>
To monitor the print job's status,
we have to get a Print Job object back
when we submit the Print Request.
Lines 72-73 do an alternate <CODE>print()</CODE> method call
that returns a <A HREF="../job/PrintJobAndLease.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintJobAndLease</A>
object,
which is just a container for a Print Job object
and its associated lease object.
The <CODE>print()</CODE> method's argument
is the requested initial duration
for the Print Job's lease.
Line 73 specifies <CODE>Lease.ANY</CODE>,
meaning the Jini Print Service instance
should pick the initial lease duration itself.
Line 74 extracts and saves the Print Job object,
an instance of interface 
<A HREF="../job/PrintJob.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintJob</A>.
<P>
A Print Job object is a leased resource.
As long as you need to use the Print Job object,
you have to keep renewing its lease.
If the Print Job's lease expires or is canceled,
the Jini Print Service instance
can perform any cleanup actions needed
and discard the Print Job object.
This lets the Jini Print Service instance
recover from a distributed failure,
such as if our client program crashes
or if a network outage occurs.
<P>
To do the lease renewal,
we'll use the LRM we constructed back on line 35.
Line 75 tells the LRM to start renewing
the Print Job's lease.
The first argument is the lease to be renewed,
namely the Print Job's lease
extracted from the 
<A HREF="../job/PrintJobAndLease.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintJobAndLease</A> object.
The second argument is the duration
for which to keep renewing the lease;
<CODE>Lease.ANY</CODE> tells the LRM
to keep on renewing the lease forever
until it is explicitly canceled.
The third argument, null,
means we're not interested
in receiving event notifications
about lease renewals.
The LRM then takes care
of renewing the Print Job's lease for us,
and we can forget about it.
<P>
Now we are ready to start monitoring the Print Job's status.
Line 76 sets up a polling loop
that is executed once a second.
A pass through the loop begins
with line 78 calling the <CODE>getAttributes()</CODE> method
on the Print Job,
which returns a
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/PrintJobAttributeSet.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintJobAttributeSet</A>
object containing a snapshot
of the Print Job's job description attribute values
at that instant.
Each time through the loop,
we must take a new snapshot;
the returned attribute set object
is <I>not</I> updated
when the Print Job's attribute values change.
<P>
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/PrintJobAttributeSet.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintJobAttributeSet</A>
specifies the interface for a restricted attribute set
that can contain only job description attributes.
A job description attribute class
implements the tagging interface
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/PrintJobAttribute.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintJobAttribute</A>.
Some printing attributes
are both job level attributes 
that can appear in a Print Request's attribute set
and job description attributes
that can appear in a Print Job's attribute set;
such attribute classes implement both tagging interfaces
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/PrintRequestAttribute.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintRequestAttribute</A>
and
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/PrintJobAttribute.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintJobAttribute</A>.
Some printing attributes
are just job description attributes
that can only appear in a Print Job's attribute set;
such attribute classes implement just the one tagging interface
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/PrintJobAttribute.html" TARGET="_parent">PrintJobAttribute</A>.
<P>
We are interested in the Print Job's
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/standard/JobState.html" TARGET="_parent">JobState</A>
attribute.
Lines 79-80 extract the job state attribute
out of the attribute set
by calling the attribute set's <CODE>get()</CODE> method.
The argument is the class of the attribute we want,
namely <CODE>JobState.class</CODE>.
The <CODE>get()</CODE> method returns
the job state attribute upcast to class Object,
so we downcast it back to class
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/standard/JobState.html" TARGET="_parent">JobState</A>
and save it.
<P>
Now we use the job state attribute.
Line 81 prints it out.
Lines 82-84 test whether the job state
is one of the three possible final states
denoted by the declared constants
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/standard/JobState.html#ABORTED" TARGET="_parent"><CODE>JobState.ABORTED</CODE></A>,
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/standard/JobState.html#CANCELED" TARGET="_parent"><CODE>JobState.CANCELED</CODE></A>, or
<A HREF="../../../../javax/print/attribute/standard/JobState.html#COMPLETED" TARGET="_parent"><CODE>JobState.COMPLETED</CODE></A>.
If the job state is one of these,
the job is finished and we exit the polling loop.
Otherwise,
the job is not finished and we stay in the polling loop,
delaying for one second on line 88
before doing the next iteration.
The program may print something like this:
<PRE>
    Job state = pending
    Job state = pending
    Job state = pending
    Job state = processing
    Job state = processing
    Job state = completed
</PRE>
After we exit the polling loop,
we no longer need to use the Print Job object.
Accordingly, line 90 tells the LRM
to cancel its lease.
<P>
Lines 107-116 add exception handlers
for two checked exceptions
thrown by the code we added.
These are needed for the code to compile.
