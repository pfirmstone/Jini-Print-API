                The Jini Print Service
                provides a printing service
                to a Jini federation.
            </P><P>
                Draft Standard Version 1.0
                of the Jini Print Service API
                represents the first version
                released from the Jini Printing Working Group
                to the entire Jini Community.
                It is denoted a "draft <I>standard</I>"
                so developers can create Jini Print Service implementations and clients
                based on a common standard.
                It is denoted a "<I>draft</I> standard"
                to recognize that implementation experience
                may necessitate changing the API
                before finalizing it as a full standard.
            </P><P>
                To learn about the Jini Print Service,
                the following course of study is recommended:

                Four additional packages are used in
                the Jini Print Service API.
                However, these packages are not part of
                the Jini Print Service API.
                Rather, they exist in the javax.print namespace
                so that they can be used
                both by the Jini Print Service API
                and by the Unified Printing API
                (Java Specification Request
                <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/jsr/jsr_006_print.html">JSR-000006</A>).

                    Attributes are used in several areas
                    of the Jini Print Service API for various purposes,
                    including discovering printer capabilities,
                    specifying print data characteristics,

                The above interaction diagram

                in printing a job
                consisting of just one doc.
                ("Doc" is a short, easy-to-pronounce term
                that means "a piece of print data.")
                The Jini Print Service instance
                supplies the Print Service, Print Request, and Print Job objects,
                and the client supplies the Doc object.

                    The client calls a method in interface

                    telling the printer

                    The printer then returns
                    a Print Request object

                    to specify the doc object to be printed
                    and a set of job-level printing attributes to use for the job.
                    The client can also register event listeners
                    to receive event notifications for the job.

                    to monitor the Print Job's progress
                    and control the Print Job as the printer processes it.
                    The client can also register event listeners
                    to receive event notifications for the job.
                    Alternatively,
                    if the client doesn't need to monitor or control the job,
                    the client can simply disregard the returned Print Job object.

                    Alternatively,
                    if the client doesn't need to monitor or control the job,
                    the client can simply disregard the returned Print Job object.
